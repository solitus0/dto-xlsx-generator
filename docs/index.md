# DtoXlsxGenerator Documentation

This documentation set follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) methodology. Pick the entry point that matches what you want to accomplish:

- **Tutorial** – Learn the workflow end-to-end in [Generate Your First Spreadsheet](tutorials/getting-started.md).
- **How-to guides** – Follow targeted recipes such as [validating DTO schemas](how-to/validate-dtos.md), and [delivering XLSX files](how-to/deliver-files.md).
- **Reference** – Look up every attribute, service, and container tag in [Attributes](reference/attributes.md) and [Services & Configuration](reference/services.md).
